## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Updated Notification Model
**File**: `lib/db/models/Notification.ts`

```typescript
{
  userId: ObjectId,           // Who receives the notification
  type: NotificationType,     // Type of notification
  title: string,              // Notification title
  message: string,            // Notification message
  link: string,               // Link to relevant content
  read: boolean,              // Read/unread status
  fromUserId: ObjectId,       // Who triggered the notification
  fromUserName: string,       // Name of triggering user
  metadata: any,              // Additional data
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Indexed Fields**:
- `userId + read + createdAt` (compound index for fast queries)

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Existing Endpoints
1. **GET /api/notifications**

   - Query params: `?limit=20` (get notifications)
   - Returns list of notifications

2. **POST /api/notifications**
   - Action: `markAllRead` - Mark all as read

### New Endpoints

   - Mark individual notification as read

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Service Layer
**File**: `lib/services/notifications.ts`

```typescript
async function createNotification(
  userId: string,
  type: NotificationType,
  title: string,
  message: string,
  link?: string,
  options?: {
    fromUserId?: string,
    fromUserName?: string,
    metadata?: any
  }
)
```

**Smart Features**:

- ✅ Error handling (won't crash app if notification fails)
- ✅ Async/await for performance
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript

### Auto-refresh Strategy
- **Polling Interval**: 30 seconds
- **On Dropdown Open**: Fetches latest notifications

- **Neutral mood (4-5)**: "Mood entry logged 😐. Remember, it's okay to have neutral days."
- **Low mood (1-3)**: "Mood entry logged 😢. We're here to support you. Consider reaching out to resources."

### Reaction Examples

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**: Fast queries on userId + read + createdAt
2. **Limit Queries**: Only fetch necessary data (10 in dropdown, 50 in page)
3. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking notification creation
4. **Error Tolerance**: App continues if notification fails
5. **Client-side Caching**: Count cached for 30 seconds

---

## 🎯 User Experience

### Notification Flow
1. **User performs action** → Mood entry, comment, reaction, etc.
2. **API creates notification** → Stored in MongoDB
3. **Bell updates** → Count increases (within 30 seconds)
4. **User clicks bell** → Sees dropdown with latest notifications
5. **User clicks notification** → Marked as read, redirected to content
6. **Count decreases** → Badge updates

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Immediate count update on bell
- ✅ Purple badge for unread
- ✅ Red notification badge
- ✅ Smooth animations
- ✅ Clear read/unread distinction

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ Users only see their own notifications
- ✅ Server-side session validation

- ✅ No self-notifications
- ✅ Secure MongoDB queries with user ID filtering

3. **Email Notifications**: Daily digest of activity
4. **Notification Preferences**: User control over notification types
5. **Rich Notifications**: Images, actions buttons
6. **Notification Groups**: Group similar notifications
7. **Mark as Unread**: Re-mark notifications
8. **Delete Notifications**: Remove unwanted notifications
9. **Sound Alerts**: Audio notification for new items
10. **Desktop Notifications**: System-level notifications

---

## 📝 Code Quality
